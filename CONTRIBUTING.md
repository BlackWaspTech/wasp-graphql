# Contributing

## Primary Goals

1 - Provide an intuitive API
2 - Provide a thin wrapper around XMR; make it easy for others to extend `wasp-graphql` for their own projects
3 - Keep the package size small

## Test Suite: [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/en/)

Available commands:

- `npm run test` to run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` to run the test watcher
- `npm run test:coverage` to generate a coverage report

## Continuous Integration

- [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)
